- A Bayesian network is a powerful tool used for modeling and reasoning about uncertainty in complex systems.

. . . 

- Building a Bayesian Network involves six key steps:
1.	Identify Variables
2.	Identify Network Structure
3.	Specify Conditional Probabilities
4.	Enter Evidence
5.	Propagate
6.	Interpret Results

. . . 

- The goal is to build an ACyclic Graph to allow us to make predictions of Income based on Seen Observations and Infer the Unseen Observation

. . . 

- We plan to test our model from test data harvested from the Adult Income Data Set
