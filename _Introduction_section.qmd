In this study, we employ Bayesian Networks to predict whether
individuals earn more than \$50,000 annually based on demographic and
employment-related attributes from the Adult Income Dataset. We use
Bayesian Networks to model probabilistic dependencies among variables,
providing a structured approach to understanding income factors. The
goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies key factors
influencing these income levels, offering a methodical approach to
understanding socioeconomic dynamics.

## I-1. What is a "Bayesian Network"?

A Bayesian network, a belief network, or a probabilistic graphical model
represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). [@pearl1986fusion] Each node in the graph
represents a random variable, and the edges between the nodes represent
probabilistic dependencies among these variables. Bayes' theorem is a
fundamental concept used in this network. It describes the probability
of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related
to the event. The formula for Bayes' theorem is $$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

This equation describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis
$(A)$ given new evidence $(B)$. Here, $P(A \mid B)$ is the posterior
probability (the probability of $(A)$ given $(B)$), $P(B \mid A)$ is the
likelihood (the probability of $(B)$ given $(A)$, $P(A)$ is the prior
probability (the initial probability of $(A)$, and $P(B)$ is the
marginal probability (the total probability of $(B)$). The formulation
of this theorem is crucial for understanding how evidence impacts our
belief in a hypothesis by combining prior knowledge with new evidence to
provide an updated probability [@Gelman2022]

## I-2. What is the Bayesian Theorem?

A simple Bayesian network can be visualized as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) with nodes representing random variables and directed edges
representing conditional dependencies between these variables.

Bayesian networks leverage Bayes' theorem to update the probabilities of
various hypotheses given new Evidence, allowing for probabilistic
reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty. The process involves
defining the network structure and conditional probabilities,
calculating joint and marginal probabilities, and applying Bayes'
theorem to infer the posterior probabilities. [@koller2009probabilistic]

An illustrative example of Bayes' Theorem in action is the Bertrand box
paradox. This paradox involves three boxes, one with two gold coins, one
with two silver coins, and one with one gold and one silver coin. If a
coin is randomly drawn from a box and it turns out to be gold, Bayes'
Theorem helps calculate the probability that the box with one gold and
one silver coin was chosen. The theorem updates the probability based on
the new evidence (the gold coin drawn) and the prior probability of each
box being chosen. [@Flusser1984]

This paradox is often used to describe the Bayes' Theorem. But instead
of having two draws with outcomes being gold and silver, it's the TV
game show where a presenter make choose a player one of the three doors.
Behind two of them are goats and behind one of them there is a car. Once
the player made his choice, the presenter of the show will open one door
where there is a goat and ask him if he wants to change door. By using
the Bayes' Theorem on this case, the result gives that the player has
more chance to get the car by changing door. The whole principle of the
Bayes' equation is used in the Bayesian Networks when taking a look at
the conditional probability tables.

### I-3. What are the advantages of using Bayesian Networks

Data analysis offers a variety of tools like rule-based systems,
decision trees, and artificial neural networks, along with techniques
such as density estimation, classification, regression, and clustering.
[@heckerman1995tutorial] What unique advantages do Bayesian networks and
Bayesian methods bring to the table in this landscape?

In the paper "A Bayesian Method for the Induction of Probabilistic
Networks from Data"[@cooper1992bayesian], here are some of the
advantages mentioned using Bayesian Networks:

**Handling Incomplete Data:**

Bayesian networks facilitate learning causal relationships, which are
crucial for understanding complex systems and making predictions under
interventions. For example, determining if increasing advertisement
exposure causes higher product sales can be analyzed using Bayesian
networks, even without direct experimental data.

**Learning Causal Relationships:**

Bayesian networks facilitate learning causal relationships, which are
crucial for understanding complex systems and making predictions under
interventions. For example, determining if increasing advertisement
exposure causes higher product sales can be analyzed using Bayesian
networks, even without direct experimental data.

**Combining Domain Knowledge and Data:**

Bayesian networks seamlessly integrate domain knowledge (prior
knowledge) with data. This domain knowledge is particularly beneficial
when data is limited or costly. Their causal semantics make it
straightforward to incorporate prior knowledge about causal
relationships, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

**Avoiding Overfitting:**

Bayesian networks provide an efficient approach to prevent overfitting.
They achieve this by "smoothing" models using all available data during
training, eliminating the need to reserve data for testing purposes.
Using all data ensures that models generalize well to new data and avoid
capturing noise or spurious patterns from the training data.

### I-4. Applications of Bayesian Networks

We widely apply Bayesian networks across diverse fields due to their
capabilities in modeling probabilistic relationships. A few examples
are - In healthcare, they are used to examine how psychiatric,
demographic, and socioeconomic variables interrelate
[@bilek2018investigation]; in supply chain management, they can play a
crucial role in assessing risks, evaluating resilience and analyzing
ripple effects - aiding in making informed decisions among
uncertainties[@hosseini2020bayesian]. In political studies, they can
assist in predicting online participation patterns by analyzing user
interactions and engagement metrics [@kopacheva2021predicting]. Bayesian
networks provide dynamic modeling, learning, and inference - enabling an
understanding of evolving systems over time in various applications
[@shiguihara2021dynamic]. All these example applications underscore the
utility of Bayesian networks in addressing complex probabilistic
challenges across different domains and further their practical
usefulness.

### I-5. Components of Bayesian Networks

Bayesian networks are sophisticated models that represent probabilistic
relationships among variables using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The
primary components of Bayesian networks include nodes, edges, and
conditional probability distributions, each playing a crucial role in
defining the network's structure and behavior.

Nodes in a Bayesian network represent random variables. The
classification of these variables falls into several categories based on
their roles within the network. Parent nodes have outgoing edges to
other nodes, signifying causal or influential relationships. On the
other hand, child nodes are the recipients of these edges, representing
variables influenced or caused by the parent nodes. Additionally,
evidence nodes are those for which we have observed data; using these
observations can update the beliefs about other variables in the
network. Query nodes are the variables of interest for which we seek to
compute posterior probabilities given the Evidence. This categorization
helps organize and understand the information flow within the network
[@pearl1986fusion].

Edges in a Bayesian network are directed and represent probabilistic
dependencies between the nodes. An edge from node A to node B indicates
that A is a parent of B, and the probability distribution of B is
conditionally dependent on the state of A. This directional relationship
is a critical aspect of Bayesian networks, as it encodes the causal
assumptions and the flow of influence among the variables es
[@pearl1986fusion].

The structure of a Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A
DAG is a directed graph containing no cycles. It is impossible to start
at any node and follow a consistent direction along the edges to return
to the starting node. This acyclic property is fundamental because it
ensures no infinite loop in the probabilistic dependencies, allowing for
coherent probabilistic inferences. The DAG structure facilitates the
decomposition of the joint probability distribution of the variables
into a product of conditional probability distributions, greatly
simplifying the representation and computation of complex probabilistic
models[@koller2009probabilistic].

Probabilistic inferences in Bayesian networks involve computing the
posterior probabilities of query nodes given the evidence nodes. This
process uses the network's structure and the conditional probability
distributions to propagate information and update beliefs. One of the
key concepts in performing these inferences is conditional independence,
which allows for significant computational efficiency. Conditional
independence means that a variable is independent of another variable
given a set of other variables, reducing the number of direct
dependencies that need to be considered [@koller2009probabilistic].

Lastly, the conditional probability tree represents the conditional
probability distributions associated with each node in the network.
These trees show how each node's probability depends on its parent
nodes' states, providing a visual and computational tool for working
with the network's probabilistic relationships [@pearl1986fusion].

Understanding these components, nodes, edges, the directed acyclic
graph, probabilistic inferences, conditional independence, and the
conditional probability tree provides a foundational framework for
working with Bayesian networks, enabling the modeling of complex systems
with interdependent variables in a structured and efficient manner.

### I-6. Limitations of Bayesian Networks

Although Bayesian networks are valuable in modeling and predicting
probabilistic relationships, they have their limitations that can hinder
effectiveness.

**Complexity**: One issue is their complexity, which increases with the
number of variables introduced. Complexity makes Bayesian Networks
computationally intensive to build and maintain for large, highly
connected networks, making real-time inference and updates challenging.
Data Requirements: Bayesian networks are largely data-driven; thus, the
data requirements make sparse data sets potentially compromise
reliability.

**Assumptions**: Bayesian networks mainly involve assumptions in
defining relationships between variables and often use expert inputs,
thus being open to subjectivity and biases [@kubsch2021beyond]. Bayesian
models assume that variables are conditionally independent given their
parents in the network. In this case, violations of these assumptions
affect the correctness of the predictions made with these models.

**Structure:** The structure is another critical limitation. Developing
a Bayesian network structure does not automatically adapt to new data or
changes in the problem domain.

**Scalability**: Scalability is a significant limitation: Large networks
require substantial computational effort for exact inference and
typically rely on approximations, resulting in lower accuracy, noting
this significant limitation [@jewell2009bayesian]. Bayesian networks are
also limited in that they cannot model complex relationships and
nonlinearity between variables; it makes them less successful in
modeling real-world complex interactions compared to other approaches,
say, neural networks. These limitations stress that careful application
and possible use of hybrid methodologies may be necessary when solving
complex problems with Bayesian networks.
